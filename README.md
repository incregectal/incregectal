this is an incremental game about gecs

an incregectal game

built in next.js

if you would like to help bugfix, that would be extremely cool

the commenting in the code itself is thorough and there will (eventually) be testing and a PR template

i do intend for this to be an open-source project...

but i would be amazed if any other developer 

on the face of the planet 

wants to touch an incregectal game
